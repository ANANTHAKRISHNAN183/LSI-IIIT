Execution starts with  Georeference file
***The textbox module is not properly written where one of the input is given manually. 

So basic idea is that when georefernce module is executed u get 2 buttons so
1)inputs based on mouse_click.
2)based on user manual input.

so when we click on mouse_click so the shapefile module gets opened and it gets executed.
and when we click on manual inputs textbox module gets executed.
But the textbox module has not been properly written inorder to execute that properly textbox module has to be made correct.

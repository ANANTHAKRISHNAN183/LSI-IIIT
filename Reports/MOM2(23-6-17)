ACTIVITIES

Mrs.Srishti Srivastava discussed about the complete idea of the project.

She clearly gave an idea on what has to be done and gave me the task of

1) extracting the plans of the vindhya building from shapes files, then finding out the extent points of that building and then overlaying the floors together so that all the entire building comes into a file 

2) asked me to give the latitude,longitude and floor of the person when we the location is tagged .

/*Applying affine Transformation of any given shape file so that it can be georeferenced.

Main work assigned to me was to when any shapefile was given i had to pick few points from the given shapefile and find out the best points from those given points and then the original shapefile had to be referenced to the map/or any other given shapefile.
A small gui had to be created for the table that contained the values obtained during the transformation and given as input for the transformation.
